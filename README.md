# Employee Attrition Prediction Project

## Objective:
Predict whether an employee is likely to leave the organization based on historical HR data. This helps HR teams take proactive measures to retain valuable talent.

---

## Tools & Technologies Used:
- **SQL**: For initial data exploration and feature extraction
- **Python**: For EDA, preprocessing, and building a predictive model
- **Power BI**: For interactive dashboard visualization

## Project Workflow:

1. **Data Exploration with SQL**  
   Used SQL queries to understand employee distribution, attrition rates, average income by department, job roles, etc.

2. **Data Analysis & Modeling in Python**  
   - Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
   - Feature engineering & preprocessing  
   - Built classification models to predict attrition  
   - Achieved ~90% accuracy

3. **Power BI Dashboard**  
   Created a dynamic dashboard to visualize patterns and KPIs related to attrition.
